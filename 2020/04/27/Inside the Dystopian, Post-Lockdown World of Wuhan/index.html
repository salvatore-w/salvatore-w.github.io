<blockquote>
<p>The first epicenter is coming back to life, but not as anyone knew it.<br>疫情的爆发地解封了，但和人们所知道的似乎有偏差。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every workday at Lenovo’s tablet and phone factory on the outskirts of Wuhan, arriving employees report to a supervisor for the first of at least four temperature checks. The results are fed into a data collection system designed by staff. Anyone above 37.3C (99.1F) is automatically flagged, triggering an investigation by an in-house “anti-virus task force.”</p>
<p>联想的武汉工厂位于市郊，前来上班的员工们都需要将体温检测的结果汇报给上级，这样的汇报每天至少需要进行四次。他们的体温检测数据将被录入工厂员工设计的系统。体温高于 37.3 摄氏度的员工将会被自动标记，之后他们会成为「疫情防控小组」调查的对象。</p>
<p>Daily routines at the facility, which reopened on March 28 after stopping for over two months because of the coronavirus pandemic that began in this central Chinese city, have been entirely reengineered to minimize the risk of infection. Before returning to the site, staff members had to be tested both for the virus and for antibodies that indicate past illness, and they had to wait for their results in isolation at a dedicated dormitory. Once cleared, they returned to work to find the capacity of meeting rooms built for six reduced to three and the formerly communal cafeteria tables partitioned off by vertical barriers covered in reminders to avoid conversation. Signs everywhere indicate when areas were last disinfected, and robots are deployed wherever possible to transport supplies, so as to reduce the number of people moving from place to place. Elevators, too, are an artifact of the Before Times; everyone now has to take the stairs, keeping their distance from others all the way.</p>
<p>由于疫情关闭了两个月的这座工厂终于在 3 月 28 日复工，工厂方重新设计了每日例行检查程序，以减少感染的风险。在复工前，工作人员必须先进行病毒和抗体的检测，员工们需要在专门的宿舍隔离等待结果。当员工们检测无异常，并回到工作岗位的时候，他们会发现，可容纳 6 人的会议室如今只能坐 3 人，食堂里的餐桌被栅栏隔开，上面贴满了提醒语，提醒人们不要交谈。所有的地方都有指示牌，指示牌上标明了上一次该处进行消毒的时间；为了防止人们四处走动，工厂使用机器人运送所有能用其运送的物资。电梯成为了一件属于疫情前的艺术品，因为如今人们得爬楼梯以保持人与人之间的距离。</p>
<p>Presiding over all these measures one Sunday in mid-April was Qi Yue, head of Wuhan operations for Beijing-based Lenovo Group Ltd. Qi, who’s 48, with closely cropped hair and a sturdy frame, had been visiting his hometown of Tianjin, in China’s north, when the government sealed off Wuhan from the rest of the country on Jan. 23. It had taken him until Feb. 9 to get home—and he was only able to make it by buying a train ticket to Changsha, farther down the line, and begging the crew to let him get off in Wuhan. His job was now to bring the factory slowly back to life while emphasizing vigilance. Compared with keeping the virus out of the plant, he said, “how much production we can deliver comes second.”</p>
<p>以上所有的决策，都是联想集团武汉工厂负责人齐岳在四月中旬的一个下午想出来的。今年 48 岁的齐岳头发有些散乱，但身体还不错。今年 1 月 23 日武汉政府宣布封城时，他还在他的老家天津。23. 疫情使得他在天津停留到了 2 月 9 日才回到武汉，而且他只能买到去长沙的票。长沙是武汉站的下一站，他向列车工作人员求情才得以在武汉提前下车。他现在的工作主要是在确保安全的前提下缓慢复工。他说，与不让病毒进入工厂相比，「产量倒是其次。」</p>
<p>Qi is one of millions of people in Wuhan trying to figure out what economic and social life looks like after the worst pandemic in a century. In some respects they’re in a decent position. The outbreak in Hubei province peaked in mid-February, and according to official statistics there are now almost no new infections occurring (though other governments have cast doubt on China’s figures). But scientists warn that the novel coronavirus is stealthy and robust, and a resurgence is still possible until there’s a reliable vaccine. How to balance that risk against the need to reignite an industrial hub of more than 10 million people is a formidable dilemma—one governments around the world will soon be facing.</p>
<p>齐岳和武汉的数百万人一样，都想知道经历了近百年来最严重的流行病后，经济和社会生活会是什么样的。在某些方面，他们的处境还算不错. 湖北省的疫情在二月中旬达到顶峰，根据中国政府发布的数据，目前几乎已经没有新感染病例出现了（尽管其他国家政府对中国发布的数据持有怀疑态度）。但是科学家认为，新冠病毒的传播具有潜伏性，传播能力非常强，在可用的疫苗出现之前，其仍有可能再次大规模爆发。如何平衡疫情风险和工业区 1000 万人复工的需求，这是一个非常可怕的难题。不止是武汉，其他国家政府在将来也会面对这个问题。</p>
<p>So far, Wuhan’s answer has been to create a version of normal that would appear utterly alien to people in London, Milan, or New York—at least for the moment. While daily routines have largely resumed, there remain significant restrictions on a huge range of activities, from funerals to hosting visitors at home. Bolstered by China’s powerful surveillance state, even the simplest interactions are mediated by a vast infrastructure of public and private monitoring intended to ensure that no infection goes undetected for more than a few hours.</p>
<p>迄今为止，武汉的解决方案对于伦敦、米兰、纽约的人们来说，是一种非常陌生的「新常态」——至少现在是这样。尽管武汉的日常活动大多都恢复了，但是像扫墓、接待客人这种大型聚集活动仍然是受限制的。在中国强大的监控体系之下，即使是最简单的交际，也会被庞大的公共和私人监控设施所记录，以确保不会错漏新增感染者。</p>
<p>But in as much as citizens can return to living as they did before January, it’s not clear, after what they’ve endured, that they really want to. Shopping malls and department stores are open again, but largely empty. The same is true of restaurants; people are ordering in instead. The subway is quiet, but autos are selling: If being stuck in traffic is annoying, at least it’s socially distanced.</p>
<p>但至少市民能恢复到 1 月前的生活状态，当然在经历了这一切之后，他们是否真的想恢复到那种状态，我们不得而知。购物商场和百货公司重新营业，但光顾者寥寥无几。各大餐馆也遇到了同样的情况，人们如今更倾向于点外卖。地铁上静默无声，但车市很红火：尽管堵车令人不快，但至少保持了社交隔离。</p>
<p>Qi figures he’s probably on the right side of this economic rebalancing. Tablets are in high demand as schools around the world switch to remote learning, and companies contemplating a work-from-home future aren’t likely to skimp on technology budgets. Since restarting operations, he’s hired more than 1,000 workers, bringing the on-site total above 10,000, and production lines are running at full capacity.</p>
<p>齐岳认为，他做出的权衡是正确的。随着各大学校开始进行远程教学，各大公司也并不会因为在家办公而削减技术预算，他们对于平板电脑的需求正在迅速上升。自复工以来，齐岳招募了 1000 多名工人，使得现场总人数超过 10000 人，生产线开始满负荷运转。</p>
<p>He said he was painfully aware, however, of how quickly work would stop if even one employee contracted the virus. “In my meetings with my staff I always tell them, ‘No loosening up, no loosening up.’ We can’t allow any accidents.”</p>
<p>他现在痛苦地领悟到，就算只有一名员工接触到了病毒，生产工作就必须迅速停止。他说：「跟我的员工开会的时候，我总是跟他们说：『不能放松，不能放松』，我们不能出任何事故。」</p>
<p>More than 80% of China’s almost 84,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, and more than 95% of the roughly 4,600 confirmed deaths, have been in Hubei, of which Wuhan is the capital and largest city. Controlling the outbreak there, after a series of mistakes by President Xi Jinping’s government, which initially downplayed the risk of human-to-human transmission and failed to prevent widespread infection of medical personnel, required a herculean effort. More than 40,000 doctors and other medical staff were dispatched from other regions to reinforce existing facilities and operate field hospitals built in the space of 10 days, and car and electronics companies were pressed into making protective gear. People suspected of having the disease were required to move into dormitories and hotels repurposed as isolation facilities, and allowed to go home only after they’d been declared infection-free.</p>
<p>中国出现的将近 84000 例确诊病例中的 80%，4600 例死亡病例中的 95% 都来自湖北省，而武汉是湖北省的省会。中国政府最初淡化了人与人之间的传播风险，也没能防控医务人员间的传染。在犯了一系列错误之后，控制疫情的爆发需要付出巨大的努力。中国动用了来自全国各地的 40000 多名医护人员加强现有医疗物资的管理， 10 天内在荒地上建造了一所医院，各大车企和电气企业被要求制造防护装备。疑似感染的人群会被送到那些被变成方舱医院的宿舍、酒店等地方，直到他们痊愈后才允许回家。</p>
<p>Hubei was the last region of China to resume daily life, with curbs on movement lifted progressively from late March until April 8, more than three months after the epidemic began. The government presented the moment as a decisive victory—part of a comprehensive effort to rewrite the narrative of the virus as a Communist Party triumph, in contrast to its catastrophic spread in Western democracies.</p>
<p>湖北是中国最后一个恢复日常生活的地区，疫情爆发的三个月后，从 3 月下旬开始到 4 月 8 日，湖北各地开始逐渐解除限制。中国政府将武汉解封的时刻视为决定性的胜利——这是将控制疫情视为胜利叙事的一部分，这是为了与新冠病毒在西方民主国家的灾难性蔓延形成鲜明对比。</p>
<p>Late on the night of April 7, crowds began arriving at Wuchang station, one of three large railway hubs in Wuhan. The first outbound train in weeks, to Guangzhou, was scheduled to leave at 12:50 a.m., followed by a dense schedule of departures to many of China’s major cities. (Wuhan’s position at the junction of several major rail and road routes, along with its industrial heft, has invited frequent comparisons to Chicago.) Police in black uniforms and medical masks seemed to be everywhere. “Scan your code!” they shouted at travelers approaching the departure gates. The public-private “health code” system that China developed to manage Covid-19, hosted on the Alipay and WeChat apps but deeply linked with the government, assigns one of three viral risk statuses—red, yellow, or green—to every citizen. It’s a powerful tool with clear potential for abuse. A green QR code, which denotes a low risk of having the virus, is the general default, while coming into contact with an infected person can trigger a yellow code and a mandatory quarantine. Red is for a likely or confirmed case.</p>
<p>4 月 7 日晚，就已经有大批人群到达武昌火车站，这是武汉三大铁路枢纽的其中一个。这几周以来首次出武昌站的列车，预计将于上午 12:50 开往广州，这之后从武汉开往中国各大城市的列车将会开始密集地发车。（武汉地处多条铁路和公路主干线的交汇处，加上武汉是工业发达的城市，所以在武汉在中国的地位相当于芝加哥在美国的地位）穿着黑色制服，佩戴口罩的警察随处可见。他们向涌入站台的乘客们大喊：「扫码！」中国开发了一套「健康码」系统，在微信和支付宝上运行，但是健康码与政府密切相关，它把所有公民的健康风险划分为了三种状态：红、黄、绿。这样的工具相当有用，但是大概率会被滥用。一般状态下，健康码是绿色的，持有绿码的用户一旦遇到了已感染患者，健康码会变黄，并被要求进行强制隔离。红码表示疑似或已感染患者。</p>
<p>Travel between cities requires a green code, and while Zeng Xiao, 22, had hers and felt fine, she was nervous about making her train. “There’s still a chance I’ll be stopped if my temperature is too high,” she said as she neared the departure zone. Before going to the station, Zeng had checked repeatedly for a fever, worried that being even a little bit warm would prevent her from getting to Guangzhou, where she works as a teacher. “I haven’t seen my cat in almost three months,” she said. She didn’t have to worry. Her temperature scan was normal, and she was soon able to board her train south.</p>
<p>出城需要出示绿码，曾晓（音译）目前就持有绿码，但她很担心她可能上不了火车。她靠近进站口，说：「如果我的体温过高，还是有可能被拦下。」去火车站之前，曾晓一遍又一遍地查看她的健康码，因为她体温有点高，害怕会因此无法前往广州工作——她是广州的一名教师。她说：「我差不多有三个月没有见到我的猫了。」她的担心是多余的，她的体温检测正常，不久之后她就能坐上南下的火车。</p>
<p>Another passenger leaving on the first day, Qin Xin’an, 26, had been stranded since the lockdown began. He’d been on vacation in Wuhan when Hubei was cut off, and no amount of pleading with officials could get him on a train out. By mid-February he was living off online loans. “I was eating instant noodles for every meal,” he said. He ended up getting a bed in an austere dormitory constructed by the local government for people who couldn’t leave. He also found work doing odd jobs at Leishenshan Hospital, one of the temporary infirmaries built to handle coronavirus patients. He’d lost his regular job, at a company in Jiangsu province that makes robots, because he couldn’t get back, and was now headed to Guangdong to look for another one and see his family. He hadn’t told his parents where he’d been all this time; as far as they knew, he was away working. “I will not tell them I was in Wuhan,” Qin said.</p>
<p>另一位在解封首日出城的乘客：26 岁的秦信安（音译），从武汉封城开始就陷入了困境。湖北封锁时他正在武汉休假，无论怎么请求官员们，都无法让他坐上火车离开武汉。二月中旬之前，他都靠网贷过日子。他说：「那时候我每一餐都是吃的方便面」最后，他住进了政府安排的为无法离开武汉的人提供的住所——一间简陋的宿舍里。他也在雷神山医院找到了一份无聊的工作——雷神山医院是为收治新冠肺炎患者而建造的一座临时医院。他之前在江苏省的一家制造机器人的公司工作，现在他失业了，如今他将前往广州另寻工作，并与他的家人团聚。他没有告诉他的家人他最近在哪里，他的家里人目前只知道他在外地工作。「我是不会告诉他们我在武汉的。」他说。</p>
<p>When dawn broke, Wuhan came cautiously back to life. Hairdressers were some of the first businesses to fill up. The roads were noticeably busier, and workers flowed back into office towers in the city center. But these new freedoms felt distinctly provisional. At the entrance to every mall or public building, guards stood sentry with temperature scanners, ready to turn away anyone whose reading was too high. Green codes, required even to ride the subway, have become the city’s most precious possession, and one that’s easy to lose. Merely visiting a building around the same time as a person later found to be infected can turn them yellow. And apartment compounds still reserve the right to bar residents from leaving if cases are reported there, as they did during the lockdown.</p>
<p>破晓时分，武汉重新开始运转，最先挤满人的地方是理发店。道路交通变得繁忙，公司雇员们回到了他们位于武汉市中心的办公室。但是这种刚获得的自由明显只是暂时的，所有写字楼和商场的门口，都有拿着体温计的保安，体温过高的人都会被他们拒绝进入。即使是乘坐地铁也需要出示的绿码，已经成为这座城市最稀缺且最容易失去的财产，有的人仅仅是和后来发现被感染的人在同一时间到过一栋楼，他们的绿码也会变成黄码。如果当地出现了感染者，物业仍有权利像封城那段时间一样拒绝住户出门。</p>
<p>Even in the first city to confront the virus, following a containment effort as intense as any in the history of public health, the danger remains acute. “Asymptomatic cases and imported cases are still risks,” Wang Xinghuan, the president of one of the city’s major hospitals and of the Leishenshan facility, told reporters at a press conference before the latter’s closing. And many residents are still susceptible. Wang’s hospital gave antibody tests to all 3,600 of its staff, and fewer than 3% came back positive—a result that shows “there’s no herd immunity in Wuhan.” There’s only one way to durably protect the population, he said: a vaccine.</p>
<p>作为第一个面对新冠病毒的城市，即使武汉推已经行了公共卫生史上最强的防护措施，危险仍然无处不在。雷神山医院院长王行环，在雷神山医院闭院的新闻发布会上告诉记者：「无症状感染者和境外输入病例仍然会带来风险。」很多居民还是很容易被感染。雷神山医院方为其 3600 名医务人员进行了抗体测试，只有 3% 不到的人呈阳性，这一结果表明「武汉并未产生群体免疫」。王行环说，只有一种办法可以持久地保护群众不受感染，那就是疫苗。</p>
<p>Wuhan’s businesses are nevertheless hoping for a safe but speedy return to conspicuous consumption. In the days before the city fully reopened for business, the sales team at a local Audi dealership gathered for their daily meeting. The 20 or so salespeople were all dressed in dark suits and face masks, standing well over a meter apart in neat columns. As a manager briefed them on the day’s plans, a colleague made his way through the group, spraying everyone with disinfectant as they spun around to ensure full coverage. “Customers may not be kind enough to tell you if they don’t feel well, so try not to bring them into the store,” the manager said. “Just talk to them at the entrance if possible.”</p>
<p>尽管如此，武汉的各大商户仍盼望炫耀型消费能在保证安全的前提下迅速出现。在武汉完全开放的前几天，当地奥迪的经销商团队就开始开始进行每日会议了。20 多个销售员身着西服，佩戴口罩，整齐地排成一列间隔为一米的 队伍。经理在向销售员们作每日计划报告的同时，会有一个人在人群中走动，向每个人喷洒消毒液，以确保每个人都被完全消毒。经理说：「顾客们可能不会告诉你他们身体不适，所以尽量不要把他们带进店里。」「尽量在门口与顾客交谈。」</p>
<p>After reopening on March 23, the dealership had been selling about seven cars per day, on pace with last year despite all the restrictions. Most were relatively low-end vehicles, such as the A3, which retails for about 200,000 yuan ($28,000)—the kind of car often bought by families to complement a bigger, fancier model. “People are not willing to take public transport in Wuhan,” said the marketing director, who asked to be identified by only his surname, Pan. “And they don’t dare commute by Didi”—the ubiquitous ride-hailing app. The focus now, Pan said, was on following up with people who’d expressed interest in an Audi in the past but hadn’t bought one. They might be ready to bite. The dealership was looking to expand its current staff of about 150, and employees would soon receive the pay they’d missed during the lockdown. Another salesperson added, “It’s like a boom.”</p>
<p>自 3 月 23 日复工以来，即便有各种限制，该团队每天仍能销售大约 7 辆汽车，与去年同期持平。卖得最好的基本都是像 A3 这样的低端车型，售价大概是 20 万人民币（折合 28000 美元）。在此之前，买这类车的家庭一般已经拥有了更大、更高端的车，买低端车是为了补足其他需求。不愿意透露全名的销售主管潘先生（音译）说：「大家都不愿意乘坐武汉的公共交通了，也不敢用滴滴打车。」滴滴是服务范围遍及全国的网约车平台。潘先生说，现在他们销售的重点客户是那些之前没有购买过奥迪车，但对购奥迪车兴趣的人，这些人可能已经准备好买车了。该经销商计划将销售团队规模扩大到约 150 人，用不了多久，团队成员就会收到他们在封城期间应得的收入。另一位销售说：「（销售量）就像爆炸了一样。」</p>
<p>For many other businesses in Wuhan, though, it’s anything but. Benny Xiao is director of international operations at Wuhan Boyuan Paper &amp; Plastic Co., which produces the kinds of unremarkable but essential goods that still form the backbone of Chinese industry. In his case, they’re disposable cups, which Boyuan sells to U.S. airlines and Japanese retailers, among other clients. Xiao works from an office inside a dilapidated residential compound, and, wearing a battered gray blazer over a green button-down, he didn’t quite look the part of an international dealmaker. But he beamed with pride as he showed off a glass cabinet in his office stuffed with examples of his craft, from thin plastic vessels for economy-class soda to a sturdy tumbler he’d tried, unsuccessfully, to sell to Starbucks Corp.</p>
<p>不过，对于武汉的其他很多企业来说，情况却不是这样的。生产那些不起眼却又必不可少的商品，至今仍是中国工业的支柱。Benny Xiao 是武汉市博源纸塑彩印制品有限公司的国际运营主管，他们公司的产品看似不起眼，但却是中国工业的中流砥柱。例如，他们生产的一次性杯子会销往美国各大航空公司和日本各大零售商。肖先生（音译）在一间破旧居民楼里的办公室工作，他穿着一件破旧的灰色西装外套，里面是一件绿色的纽扣衫，看起来并不像个国际商人，但当他在展示办公室里的玻璃柜时，脸上笑容却充满着自信。这个柜子里陈列着公司的所有产品，从最便宜的装苏打水的塑料容器，到他向星巴克推销过但对方并未采用的硬质玻璃杯。</p>
<p>The first months of the pandemic were challenging for Xiao, as they were for everyone in Wuhan. His wife, now retired, spent her career as a doctor at Xiehe Hospital, one of the first to report cases of what was later identified as the coronavirus, and she’d begun hearing from colleagues in mid-January about the impending crisis. Sick residents “were lining up outside Xiehe at 10 p.m. in the freezing cold,” many of them “older people who could barely make it,” Xiao recalled. “Patients were really desperately looking for help.” He and his wife had stocked up on food before the lockdown began, but three weeks in they started to run out. Unlike in Europe and the U.S., Wuhan’s containment measures made it difficult for people to leave their buildings, even to buy groceries, forcing them to rely on delivery apps, government drop-offs, and neighbors who wrangled permission to go out. At one point, Xiao had to spend 26 yuan (almost $4) for a single cabbage, more than triple the usual price. Some of the vegetables provided by local officials were barely edible.</p>
<p>像所有的武汉人一样，疫情发生的前几个月对于肖先生而言是非常有挑战性的。他的爱人曾是武汉协和医院的一名医生，如今已经退休了。协和医院是最先检测出新冠病毒感染者的医院，肖先生的爱人从一月中旬就得到了危机即将来临的消息。据肖先生回忆，病人「在协和门口排长队，那时候是晚上十点，天气特别冷」很多人都是「根本经不住冻老人」， 「病人们都是绝望地在等待救治」。肖先生夫妇在封城前就囤了很多食物，但三周后这些食物就快被吃完了。不像美国和欧洲地区的封城，武汉政府的隔离措施使得人们难以离开自己所住的地方，即使是买菜都不行，居民们只能依赖于外卖软件、政府的救助物资、还有那些得到出门许可的邻居。有段时间，肖先生需要花 26 元人民币（折合约 4 美元）才能买到一棵包菜，是正常价格的三倍，当地政府提供的蔬菜也难以下咽。</p>
<p>He returned in late March to a company in severe trouble. Orders in the first half of the year were headed for a 50% drop, with demand from food deliveries failing to offset the calamitous decline in air travel. The government had made some financial help available, but Xiao wasn’t sure he’d be able to avoid layoffs. “Back in January and February, I was expecting things to come back to normal in April,” he said. Instead, “I was just calling the bank this morning to tell them that I can’t repay the interest on our loan.”</p>
<p>当他在 3 月底回到公司的时候，公司已经面临了很严重的困境：今年上半年的订单量下降了 50%，即使市场对于运输食品的需求提高，但航班的数量还是减少了。尽管政府提供了一些经济援助，但肖先生感觉裁员还是逃不过。他说：「一月和二月的时候，我还希望四月份会一切恢复正常，」而如今，「然后我今天早晨就给银行打了电话，我告诉他们我们无法偿还贷款的利息。」</p>
<p>For a country that’s experienced an essentially uninterrupted boom throughout the living memory of anyone younger than 50, broad-based economic pain is deeply unfamiliar. The Chinese economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter of the year, and the International Monetary Fund estimates it will grow just 1.2% in 2020, the worst performance since 1976. Urban unemployment, a widely scrutinized indicator of overall joblessness, rose to a record 6.2% in February before pulling back slightly in March. And it’s not clear what China’s business model will look like in a world where Europe, the U.S., and other key markets for its goods are flirting with a depression.</p>
<p>在年龄 50 岁左右的这代中国人的记忆里，中国一直以来经济就是在不断走向繁荣的，从来没有出现过大范围的经济危机。第一季度中国的经济缩水了 6.8%，据国际货币基金组织预测，中国 2020 年的经济增速将为 1.2%，创下 1976 年以来的新低。城镇失业率，一个被广泛关注的总失业率指标，在 2 月份升至 6.2% 并创下了历史新高，3 月份小幅回落。现在欧洲、美国和其他主要的商品市场都在面临萧条，在此大环境下，中国的商业模式会变成什么样，我们不得而知。</p>
<p>Xiao is 64, part of a Chinese generation that had seen more than its share of history even before the coronavirus emerged. But he struggled to recall anything in his experience that was more dramatic, save perhaps the famine of the Great Leap Forward, when he was a young child. “This is the biggest crisis of my lifetime,” he said.</p>
<p>肖先生已经 64 岁了，他们这代人在新冠疫情出现之前，就已经见证了不少的历史时刻。他努力回忆起自己的经历中是否还有比这更富有戏剧性的时刻，结果好像除了年幼时经历的大跃进的大饥荒，就再也没有了。他说：「这是我人生中最大的一次危机。」</p>
<p>The entrance to Wuhan’s Biandanshan Cemetery is marked by an impressive stone gate with a pagoda-style roof and a frieze of a ferocious-looking dragon. But in recent weeks, it’s been partly hidden behind a series of bright yellow crowd control barriers surrounded by temporary metal fencing and watched carefully by police. Almost no one is permitted to enter until April 30, and even then access is likely to be strictly controlled.</p>
<p>武汉扁担山公墓入口的标志是一个令人印象深刻的石门，它有着塔式屋顶，门楣上刻着一条凶猛的龙。但近几周，这扇门被一条明黄色的人群控制栏挡住了一部分，四周围上了临时的金属围栏，还有警察在这里巡逻。4 月 30 日前这里不允许任何人进入，而且即使是过了 4 月 30 日，这里仍然无法随意进出。</p>
<p>Officially, no patients in Wuhan are still dying from Covid-19, but the treatment of those who did pass away remains an extremely sensitive subject. On Tomb-Sweeping Day in early April, when Chinese families traditionally gather to pay respects to their ancestors, Wuhan’s cemeteries were kept closed. Funerals have been banned until at least the end of the month, and family members of the dead have reported pressure from government officials to mourn quickly and quietly. According to the government, these measures are purely a matter of public health, because family gatherings are a potential vector for infection. But the restrictions also help Beijing avoid having funerals become a venue for people to vent anger about how the epidemic was handled, or to ask uncomfortable questions about subjects such as China’s true death toll.</p>
<p>据官方数据，武汉的新增死亡病例已经清零，但是如何去处理那些已经去世的患者成了一个敏感话题。在中国传统中，清明节是集体祭奠家族先辈们的日子，但在这一天，武汉的各大公墓仍然不对外开放。根据规定，四月底之前不允许举办任何葬礼，政府要求逝者亲属们迅速而安静地进行祭扫。根据政府发布的信息，这样的规定仅仅是考虑到公众的健康，因为家庭聚会是潜在的传染因素。但是对于中国政府而言，这样的规定实际上还有助于防止人们因为葬礼而对国家应对疫情的政策产生不满，或者对诸如中国的真实死亡人数产生质疑。</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons for maintaining the ban, some mental health providers in Wuhan have expressed fears that the inability to properly mourn loved ones will have deep and enduring psychological consequences. The city’s residents were the first to undergo the unprecedented social shutdown that’s been repeated around the world, and it seems certain to mark many of them for a long time, especially if it’s compounded by a prolonged economic slump.</p>
<p>抛开施行这些禁令的理由不看，武汉的一些心理专家现在很担心如果人们无法去悼念他们所爱的人，那么他们可能会产生深刻而持久的内心创伤。这个城市的居民第一次经历这种被全世界不断强调的「前所未有的社交隔离」，这势必会在很长一段时间内给他们留下深刻印象，特别是还有因隔离带来的长期性的经济萧条。</p>
<p>Yao Jun is among those struggling to move on. The petite 50-year-old is the founder and general manager of Wuhan Welhel Photoelectric Co., a manufacturer of welding helmets and protective masks that exports to France, Germany, and the U.S. She came back to work on March 13 after wading through approvals from four layers of government, including her local neighborhood committee, which took 15 days to assess Welhel’s ability to prevent infections. “We can’t afford to have a single one,” Yao said in an interview at her factory. Every day the production line can run is crucial: Welhel was trying to catch up on orders it hadn’t been able to complete in the first few months of the year, even as Yao wasn’t sure her customers in locked-down overseas markets would be able to take the deliveries. She had no idea when more business would come in, given what’s happening to the global economy.</p>
<p>姚军就是在挣扎中前行的人群中的一个。这位 50 岁的身材娇小的女性，是武汉威和光电股份有限公司的创始人和总经理，该公司主要生产焊接头盔和防护面罩，并出口至法国、德国和美国。她的公司于 3 月 13 日复工，复工前，公司好不容易经过了政府的四道审批，这其中包括当地社区委员会对工厂进行的长达 15 天的防控能力评估。在一次地点在工厂的采访中，姚军说：「哪怕只有一个人感染，我们也承担不起这个责任。」生产线能够运行的每一天都是至关重要的。工厂目前正在努力完成今年年初时未能完成的订单，尽管姚军拿不准海外市场开始封闭后，她的客户是否还会接收他们的货物。就现在全球经济状况来看，她不知道什么时候才会有更多生意。</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainties, she was trying to focus on work rather than what the city had just gone through. “I can’t see news about medical workers without crying,” Yao said, choking back tears and rubbing a jade keychain attached to her phone. She was having trouble sleeping, as she turned over the stories of doctors and nurses who’d succumbed to Covid-19 again and again in her head: “I don’t know these people, but if someone tells me what happened to them, it’s devastating. These deaths aren’t just numbers or strange names to me. They’re vivid lives.” She believed that many of her neighbors and colleagues were experiencing similar emotions but might not be willing or able to talk about them. “Many other people are traumatized but can’t recognize the problem or express their feelings,” she said.</p>
<p>不确定的因素有很多，但她还是努力把精力投入到工作中，而不是刚刚她经历过的事情上。姚军哽咽了，她抚摸着手机上挂着的玉石吊坠说：「我一看到电视里关于医护人员的新闻，我就想哭。」她最近晚上都睡不着，关于因新冠病毒而死去的医护人员的故事总是在她脑海中反复萦绕，她说：「我不认识这些人，但只要有人告诉过我他们经历的那些事，我就撑不住了。这些死去的人不是一串数字，也不是一串陌生的名字，他们都是一条条人命。」她觉得她的邻居和同时最近也会有类似的情绪，但他们也选择，亦或是只能缄默。她说：「还有很多人可能已经形成了心理创伤，但他们可能自己都不知道，或者不能向别人倾诉。」</p>
<p>The pandemic was causing Yao to rethink her life. She spent almost half of last year on the road, often visiting clients overseas. Now, she said, she wanted to spend much more time at home, keeping her family close. Her son was supposed to return to Australia for university in February, but he was unable to get there, for obvious reasons. Yao didn’t want him to go back.</p>
<p>疫情使得姚军开始重新思考人生。在过去的一年里，她有一半时间都在国外拜访客户；如今，她说她想用更多时间陪伴家人。她的儿子原定于 2 月份回澳大利亚读大学，但由于众所周知的原因无法成行，现在姚军不想让他回澳大利亚了。</p>
<p>Even after seemingly world-shattering events, human behavior has a way of reverting to the mean. In the weeks after Sept. 11, commentators predicted the end of globalization, of the skyscraper, of irony—which all, needless to say, persisted. Within a couple of years of the global financial crisis, banks and homebuyers were back to arranging risky mortgages, and the very wealthy were back to, and then well beyond, pre-2008 levels of excess.</p>
<p>即使发生了惊天动地的大事件，人们的生活最终也会回归正常。9/11 事件之后，政治评论家们预言全球化将会终结、世贸大厦不会重建、各种冷嘲热讽将不复存在——但在最终，这些预测都被推翻了。世界金融危机还没过去几年，银行和购房者又开始进行高风险抵押，最富有的那批人又开始进行超额抵押，相比 2008 年前有过之而无不及。</p>
<p>It’s reasonable to think this time will be different. Hardly anyone alive today has endured a pandemic this severe, and the basic problem it’s created—that anyone, whether friend, family, or stranger, might be a vector for lethal infection—is uniquely corrosive to the daily interactions that keep countries and economies going. An effective vaccine could be at least a year off, and given what the world has learned about how quickly a novel pathogen can shut everything down, even that might not return things to the way they were. Wuhan was the first place to traverse both sides of the Covid-19 curve, and how it changes, or doesn’t, in the disease’s aftermath will say a lot to the rest of us.</p>
<p>我们有理由相信这次和之前都不相同，现在在地球上生活着的所有人，几乎没有人经历过这么严重的流行病，也没有人面对过其产生的最基本的问题：每个人，不管是你的朋友、家人或是陌生人，都可能成为致命性病毒的携感染者。不管是对于国家和经济运转，还是人们的日常生活，这都是具有腐蚀性的。有效疫苗的研发可能需要至少一年之久，即便是现在整个世界的人都意识到即使是一个新增病例也会使一切停止运转，意识到失去的都会一去不复返。武汉是第一个到达新冠病毒感染曲线末端的城市，不管之后感染曲线还会不会变，它给活着的我们带来的创伤都是巨大的。</p>
<p>Many of the city’s methods won’t be universally applicable. Few other governments could assemble the all-seeing anti-viral surveillance China is trying to put in place, even if they wanted to. Fewer still, probably, have populations that would tolerate it. But whatever the tactics, the key lesson of Wuhan could be that the price of beating the virus is never-ending vigilance and a reordering of priorities that will be hard for many to accept.</p>
<p>这个城市很多控制疫情的措施都是无法复制的，其他政府即便愿意，也很难推行中国试图实施的无所不包的防疫政策。当然，有一小部分国家的民众可能会支持这种政策，但不管是用什么方式，武汉已经告诉我们防疫需要付出的代价是永远需要保持警惕，以及各项事务的轻重缓急需要重新思考，这样的代价很多人都是难以接受的。</p>
<p>At a Starbucks in one of Wuhan’s fancier shopping districts, Ma Renren, a 32-year-old entrepreneur who runs a small marketing agency, talked about how he was sorting out these questions for himself. The store was open but only serving drinks to go, with customers permitted to sit at outdoor tables. Security guards were keeping a close eye on things, interrupting conversations to tell patrons to keep their masks on between sips and not sit too close together. Ma, who was wearing fashionably oversize glasses, a black baseball cap, and—of course—a light blue medical mask, had gone to stay at his parents’ apartment on Jan. 24, intending to help take care of them. But soon he began to suspect that he might be sick. It was a time of greatly heightened emotion: No one knew the true fatality rate, and people in Wuhan were seeing reports on social media of appalling conditions in overwhelmed hospitals. “I wrote my last words one night and decided to say farewell to my parents and go to the hospital alone the next morning,” Ma recalled. “I knew that if I went, I couldn’t necessarily expect to come back.”</p>
<p>马仁人（音译）是一位 32 岁的企业家，目前掌管着一家营销机构，他在武汉繁华商圈里的一家星巴克告诉了我们他梳理这些问题的方式。星巴克已经开始营业了，但饮料只允许外带，顾客们可以在室外的桌子旁就座。保安人员在一旁紧紧盯着，他们不时会打断谈话，告诉顾客们在喝完饮料后要戴上口罩，不要坐得太近。马先生戴着时尚的大号墨镜，头上戴着一顶棒球帽，脸上戴着那必不可少的蓝色口罩。他说，为了帮忙照顾父母，1 月 24 日，他就去父母的房子里住下了。但没过多久，他就开始感觉自己的身体不对劲。那段时间，群众们的情绪高涨，因为没有人知道真实的死亡率，武汉人在社交媒体上看到的都是关于医院被挤满的可怕的报导。马先生回忆说：「一天晚上，我写下了我的遗言，打算跟父母告别，然后一个人去医院看病，因为我知道一旦去了，就不知道能不能再回来了。」</p>
<p>He changed his mind at the last minute and eventually felt better, though the psychological effects lingered. He began having panic attacks, his breath short and his heart pounding. After looking up the symptoms online, he concluded that he was experiencing post-traumatic stress. Experiences like his, Ma thought, would make many people more introspective and more focused on those closest to them. “We will put aside more time for ourselves and our families” and for the other relationships that seemed truly worth holding on to during the crisis, he said. “Misfortune tests the sincerity of friendship.”</p>
<p>他在最后一刻反悔了，身体也开始好转，尽管这还是给他留下了心理阴影。他开始心慌意乱、呼吸急促、心跳加速，他上网查了这些症状，最后得出的结论是：他可能正在经历创伤后压力。马先认为，这样的经历，会让很多人更加注重内省，更加关注他们最亲近的人。他说：「我们要为我们自己和我们的家人留出更多时间，」还有那些在危机中真正值得坚守的关系，「毕竟患难见真情。」</p>
<p>Ma was now trying to get his company back on its feet. The government had recently sent him a tax rebate as part of its stimulus measures, but this would help only so much. Tourism has collapsed, and few potential clients have much money for promotion. “There’s nothing to do but move on,” he said. Ma had, inevitably, lowered his ambitions, and for the time being he was all right with that. “We worked nonstop for years, chasing every opportunity,” he said. Now, “everyone I know has one goal for 2020. It’s to survive.”</p>
<p>马先生现在想让自己的公司重新振作起来，最近政府给了他的公司一笔退税款，这是政府刺激经济的措施之一，但这并不能给他带来多少帮助。旅游业面临崩溃，他现在已经没有几个潜在客户有钱做营销了。他说：「我们只能继续前行。」马先生的商业野心已经没有那么强了，就目前而言，他觉得这没问题。他说：「以前我们起早贪黑地工作，努力抓住各种机会，」现在，「我认识的所有人，2020 年的目标都是：活下来。」</p>

<div id="中文" class="tab-content">
<blockquote>
<p>疫情的爆发地解封了，但与人们所知道的似乎有偏差。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>联想的武汉工厂位于市郊，前来上班的员工们都需要将体温检测的结果汇报给上级，这样的汇报每天至少需要进行四次。他们的体温检测数据将被录入工厂员工设计的系统。体温高于 37.3 摄氏度的员工将会被自动标记，之后他们会成为「疫情防控小组」调查的对象。</p>
<p>由于疫情关闭了两个月的这座工厂终于在 3 月 28 日复工，工厂方重新设计了每日例行检查程序，以减少感染的风险。在复工前，工作人员必须先进行病毒和抗体的检测，员工们需要在专门的宿舍隔离等待结果。当员工们检测无异常，并回到工作岗位的时候，他们会发现，可容纳 6 人的会议室如今只能坐 3 人，食堂里的餐桌被栅栏隔开，上面贴满了提醒语，提醒人们不要交谈。所有的地方都有指示牌，指示牌上标明了上一次该处进行消毒的时间；为了防止人们四处走动，工厂使用机器人运送所有能用其运送的物资。电梯成为了一件属于疫情前的艺术品，因为如今人们需要爬楼梯以保持人与人之间的距离。</p>
<p>以上所有的决策，都是联想集团武汉工厂负责人齐岳在四月中旬的一个下午想出来的。今年 48 岁的齐岳头发有些散乱，但身体还不错。1 月 23 日武汉政府宣布封城时，他还在他的老家天津。疫情使得他在天津滞留到了 2 月 9 日才回到武汉，而且他只能买到去长沙的高铁票。长沙是武汉站的下一站，他向列车工作人员求情才得以在武汉提前下车。他现在的工作主要是在确保安全的前提下缓慢复工，他说，与不让病毒进入工厂相比，「产量倒是其次。」</p>
<p>齐岳和武汉的数百万人一样，都想知道经历了近百年来最严重的流行病后，经济和社会生活会是什么样的。在某些方面，他们的处境还算不错。湖北省的疫情在二月中旬达到顶峰，根据中国政府发布的数据，目前几乎已经没有新感染病例出现了（尽管其他国家对中国发布的数据持有怀疑态度）。但是科学家认为，新冠病毒的传播具有潜伏性，传播能力非常强，在可用的疫苗出现之前，其仍有可能再次大规模爆发。如何平衡疫情风险和工业区 1000 万人复工的需求，这是一个非常可怕的难题。不只是武汉，其他国家政府在将来也会面对这个问题。</p>
<p>迄今为止，武汉的解决方案对于伦敦、米兰、纽约的人们来说，是一种非常陌生的「新常态」——至少现在是这样。尽管武汉的日常活动大多都恢复了，但是像扫墓、接待客人这种大型聚集活动仍然是受限制的。在中国强大的监控体系之下，即使是最简单的交际，也会被数量庞大的公共和私人监控设施所记录，以确保不会错漏新增感染者。</p>
<p>但至少市民能恢复到 1 月前的生活状态，当然在经历了这一切之后，他们是否真的想恢复到那种状态，我们不得而知。购物商场和百货公司重新营业，但光顾者寥寥无几。各大餐馆也遇到了同样的情况，人们如今更倾向于点外卖。地铁上静默无声，但车市很红火：尽管堵车令人不快，但开车至少能保持社交隔离。</p>
<p>齐岳认为，他做出的权衡是正确的。随着各大学校开始进行远程教学，各大公司也并不会因为在家办公而削减技术预算，他们对于平板电脑的需求都在迅速上升。自复工以来，齐岳招募了 1000 多名工人，使得现场总人数超过 10000 人，生产线开始满负荷运转。</p>
<p>他现在痛苦地领悟到，就算只有一名员工接触到了病毒，生产工作就必须迅速停止。他说：「跟我的员工开会的时候，我总是跟他们说：『不能放松，不能放松』，我们不能出任何事故。」</p>
<p>中国出现的将近 84000 例确诊病例中的 80%，4600 例死亡病例中的 95% 都来自湖北省，而武汉是湖北省的省会。中国政府最初淡化了人与人之间的传播风险，也没能防控医务人员间的传染。在犯了一系列错误之后，控制疫情的爆发需要付出巨大的努力。中国动用了来自全国各地的 40000 多名医护人员加强现有医疗物资的管理，10 天内在荒地上建造了一所医院，各大车企和电气企业被要求制造防护装备。疑似感染的人群会被送到那些被变成方舱医院的宿舍、酒店进行隔离，直到他们痊愈后才允许回家。</p>
<p>湖北是中国最后一个恢复日常生活的地区，疫情爆发的三个月后，从 3 月下旬开始到 4 月 8 日，湖北各地开始逐渐解除限制。中国政府将武汉解封的时刻视为决定性的胜利——这是将控制疫情视为胜利叙事的一部分，这是为了与新冠病毒在西方民主国家的灾难性蔓延形成鲜明对比。</p>
<p>4 月 7 日晚，就已经有大批人群到达武昌火车站，这是武汉三大铁路枢纽的其中一个。这几周以来首次发出武昌站的列车，预计将于上午 12:50 开往广州，这之后从武汉开往中国各大城市的列车将会开始密集地发车。（武汉地处多条铁路和公路主干线的交汇处，加上武汉是工业发达的城市，所以在武汉在中国的地位相当于芝加哥在美国的地位）穿着黑色制服，佩戴口罩的警察随处可见。他们向涌入站台的乘客们大喊：「扫码！」中国开发了一套「健康码」系统，在微信和支付宝上运行，但是健康码与政府密切相关，它把所有公民的健康风险划分为了三种状态：红、黄、绿。这样的工具相当有用，但是大概率会被滥用。一般状态下，健康码是绿色的，持有绿码的用户一旦遇到了已感染患者，健康码会就变黄，用户会被要求进行强制隔离，而红码则表示疑似或已感染患者。</p>
<p>出城需要出示绿码，曾晓（音译）目前就持有绿码，但她很担心她可能上不了火车。她靠近进站口，说：「如果我的体温过高，还是有可能被拦下。」去火车站之前，曾晓一遍又一遍地查看她的健康码，因为她体温有点高，害怕会因此无法前往广州工作——她是广州的一名教师。她说：「我差不多有三个月没有见到我的猫了。」她的担心是多余的，她的体温检测正常，不久之后她就能坐上南下的火车。</p>
<p>另一位在解封首日出城的乘客：26 岁的秦信安（音译），从武汉封城开始就陷入了困境。湖北封锁时他正在武汉休假，无论怎么请求官员们，都无法让他坐上火车离开武汉。二月中旬之前，他需要靠网贷过日子。他说：「那时候我每一餐都是吃的方便面。」最后，他住进了政府安排的为无法离开武汉的人提供的住所——一间简陋的宿舍里。他也在雷神山医院找到了一份无聊的工作——雷神山医院是为收治新冠肺炎患者而建造的一座临时医院。他之前在江苏省的一家制造机器人的公司工作，现在他失业了，如今他将前往广州另寻工作，并与他的家人团聚。他没有告诉他的家人他最近在哪里，他的家里人目前只知道他在外地工作。他说：「我是不会告诉他们我在武汉的。」。</p>
<p>破晓时分，武汉重新开始运转，最先挤满人的地方是理发店。道路交通变得繁忙，公司雇员们回到了他们位于武汉市中心的办公室。但是这种刚获得的自由明显只是暂时的，所有写字楼和商场的门口，都有拿着体温计的保安，体温过高的人都会被他们拒绝进入。即使是乘坐地铁也需要出示的绿码，已经成为这座城市最稀缺且最容易失去的财产，有的人仅仅是和后来发现被感染的人在同一时间到过同一栋楼，他们的绿码也会变成黄码。如果当地出现了感染者，物业仍有权利像封城那段时间一样拒绝住户出门。</p>
<p>作为第一个面对新冠病毒的城市，即使武汉已经推行了公共卫生史上最强的防护措施，危险仍然无处不在。雷神山医院院长王行环在雷神山医院闭院的新闻发布会上告诉记者：「无症状感染者和境外输入病例仍然会带来风险。」很多居民还是很容易被感染。雷神山医院方为其 3600 名医务人员进行了抗体测试，只有 3% 不到的人呈阳性，这一结果表明「武汉并未产生群体免疫」。王行环说，只有一种办法可以持久地保护群众不受感染，那就是疫苗。</p>
<p>尽管如此，武汉的各大商户仍希望炫耀型消费能在保证安全的前提下迅速出现。在武汉完全开放的前几天，当地的奥迪经销商团队就开始举行每日会议了。20 多个销售员身着西服，佩戴口罩，整齐地排成一列间隔为一米的队伍。经理在向销售员们作每日计划报告的同时，会有一个人在人群中走动，向每个人喷洒消毒液，以确保每个人都被完全消毒。经理说：「顾客们可能不会告诉你他们身体不适，所以尽量不要把他们带进店里。」、「尽量在门口与顾客交谈。」</p>
<p>自 3 月 26 日复工以来，即便有各种限制，该团队每天仍能销售大约 7 辆汽车，与去年同期持平。卖得最好的基本都是像 A3 这样的低端车型，售价大概是 20 万人民币（折合 28000 美元）。在此之前，买这类车的家庭一般已经拥有了更大、更高端的车，买低端车是为了补足其他需求。不愿意透露全名的销售主管潘先生（音译）说：「大家都不愿意乘坐武汉的公共交通了，也不敢用滴滴打车。」滴滴是服务范围遍及全国的网约车平台。潘先生说，现在他们销售的重点客户是那些之前没有购买过奥迪车，但对购奥迪车感兴趣的人，这些人可能已经准备好买车了。该经销商计划将销售团队规模扩大到约 150 人，用不了多久，团队成员就会收到他们在封城期间应得的收入。另一位销售说：「（销售量）就像爆炸了一样。」</p>
<p>不过，对于武汉的其他很多企业来说，情况却不是这样的。Benny Xiao 是武汉市博源纸塑彩印制品有限公司的国际运营主管，他们公司的产品看似不起眼，但却是中国工业的中流砥柱。例如，他们生产的一次性杯子会销往美国各大航空公司和日本各大零售商。肖先生（音译）在一间破旧居民楼里的办公室工作，他穿着一件破旧的灰色西装外套，里面是一件绿色的纽扣衫，看起来并不像个国际商人，但当他在展示办公室里的玻璃柜时，脸上笑容却充满着自信。这个柜子里陈列着公司的所有产品，从最便宜的装苏打水的塑料容器，到他向星巴克推销过但对方并未采用的硬质玻璃杯。</p>
<p>像所有的武汉人一样，疫情发生的前几个月对于肖先生而言是非常有挑战性的。他的爱人曾是武汉协和医院的一名医生，如今已经退休了。协和医院是最先检测出新冠病毒感染者的医院，肖先生的爱人从一月中旬就得到了危机即将来临的消息。据肖先生回忆，病人「在协和门口排长队，那时候是晚上十点，天气特别冷」很多人都是「根本经不住冻的老人，病人们都是绝望地在等待救治」。肖先生夫妇在封城前就囤了很多食物，但三周后这些食物就快见底了。不像美国和欧洲地区的封城，武汉政府的隔离措施使得人们难以离开自己所住的地方，即使是买菜都不行，居民们只能依赖于外卖软件、政府的救助物资、还有那些得到出门许可的邻居。有段时间，肖先生需要花 26 元人民币（折合约 4 美元）才能买到一棵包菜，是正常价格的三倍，当地政府提供的蔬菜也难以下咽。</p>
<p>当他在 3 月底回到公司的时候，公司已经面临了很严重的困境：今年上半年的订单量下降了 50%，虽然市场对于运输食品的需求提高，但航班的数量还是减少了。尽管政府提供了一些经济援助，但肖先生感觉裁员还是逃不过。他说：「一月和二月的时候，我还希望四月份会一切恢复正常，」而如今，「然后我今天早晨就给银行打了电话，我告诉他们我们无法偿还贷款的利息。」</p>
<p>在年龄 50 岁左右的这代中国人的记忆里，中国经济一直以来就是在不断走向繁荣的，从来没有出现过大范围的经济危机。今年第一季度，中国的经济缩水了 6.8%，据国际货币基金组织预测，中国 2020 年的经济增速将为 1.2%，创下 1976 年以来的新低。城镇失业率，一个被广泛关注的总失业率指标，在 2 月份升至 6.2% 并创下了历史新高，3 月份小幅回落。现在欧洲、美国和其他主要的商品市场都在面临萧条，在此大环境下，中国的商业模式会变成什么样，我们不得而知。</p>
<p>肖先生已经 64 岁了，他们这代人在新冠疫情出现之前，就已经见证了不少的历史时刻。他努力回忆起自己的经历中是否还有比这更富有戏剧性的时刻，结果好像除了年幼时经历的大跃进的大饥荒，就再也没有了。他说：「这是我人生中最大的一次危机。」</p>
<p>武汉扁担山公墓入口的标志是一个令人印象深刻的石门，它有着塔式屋顶，门楣上刻着一条凶猛的龙。但近几周，这扇门被一条明黄色的人群控制栏挡住了一部分，四周围上了临时的金属围栏，还有警察在这里巡逻。4 月 30 日前这里不允许任何人进入，而且即使是过了 4 月 30 日，这里仍然无法随意进出。</p>
<p>据官方数据，武汉的新增死亡病例已经清零，但是如何去处理那些已经去世的患者成了一个敏感话题。在中国传统中，清明节是集体祭奠家族先辈们的日子，但在这一天，武汉的各大公墓仍然不对外开放。根据规定，四月底以前不允许举办任何葬礼，政府要求逝者亲属们迅速而安静地进行祭扫。根据政府发布的信息，这样的规定仅仅是考虑到公众的健康，因为家庭聚会是潜在的传染因素。但是对于中国政府而言，这样的规定实际上还有助于防止人们因为葬礼而对国家应对疫情的政策产生不满，或者对诸如中国的真实死亡人数产生质疑，</p>
<p>抛开施行这些禁令的理由不看，武汉的一些心理专家现在很担心如果人们无法去悼念他们所爱的人，那么他们可能会产生深刻而持久的内心创伤。这个城市的居民第一次经历这种被全世界不断强调的「前所未有的社交隔离」，这势必会在很长一段时间内给他们留下深刻印象，特别是还有因隔离带来的长期性的经济萧条。</p>
<p>姚军就是在挣扎中前行的人群中的一个。这位 50 岁的身材娇小的女性，是武汉威和光电股份有限公司的创始人和总经理，该公司主要生产焊接头盔和防护面罩，并出口至法国、德国和美国。她的公司于 3 月 13 日复工，复工前，公司好不容易经过了政府的四道审批，这其中包括当地社区委员会对工厂进行的长达 15 天的防控能力评估。在一次地点在工厂的采访中，姚军说：「哪怕只有一个人感染，我们也承担不起这个责任。」生产线能够运行的每一天都是至关重要的。工厂目前正在努力完成今年年初时未能完成的订单，尽管姚军拿不准海外市场开始封闭后，她的客户是否还会接收他们的货物。就现在全球经济状况来看，她不知道什么时候才会有更多生意。</p>
<p>不确定的因素有很多，但她还是努力把精力投入到工作中，而不是她刚刚经历过的事情上。姚军哽咽了，她抚摸着手机上挂着的玉石吊坠说：「我一看到电视里关于医护人员的新闻，我就想哭。」她最近晚上都睡不着，关于因新冠病毒而死去的医护人员的故事总是在她脑海中反复萦绕，她说：「我不认识这些人，但只要有人告诉过我他们经历的那些事，我就撑不住了。这些死去的人不是一串数字，也不是一串陌生的名字，他们都是一条条人命。」她觉得她的邻居和同事最近也会有类似的情绪，但他们也选择，抑或是只能缄默。她说：「还有很多人可能已经形成了心理创伤，但他们可能自己都不知道，或者不能向别人倾诉。」</p>
<p>疫情使得姚军开始重新思考人生。在过去的一年里，她有一半时间都在国外拜访客户；如今，她说她想用更多时间陪伴家人。她的儿子原定于 2 月份回澳大利亚读大学，但由于众所周知的原因无法成行，现在姚军不想让他回澳大利亚了。</p>
<p>即使发生了惊天动地的大事件，人们的生活最终也会回归正常。9/11 事件之后，政治评论家们预言全球化将会终结、世贸大厦不会重建、各种冷嘲热讽将不复存在——但在最终，这些预测都被推翻了。世界金融危机还没过去几年，银行和购房者又开始进行高风险抵押，最富有的那批人又开始进行超额抵押，相比 2008 年前有过之而无不及。</p>
<p>我们有理由相信这次和以前都不相同，现在在地球上生活着的所有人，几乎没有人经历过这么严重的流行病，也没有人面对过其产生的最基本的问题：每个人，不管是你的朋友、家人或是陌生人，都可能成为致命性病毒的感染者。不管是对于国家和经济运转，还是人们的日常生活，这都是具有腐蚀性的。有效疫苗的研发可能需要至少一年之久，即便是现在整个世界的人都意识到即使是一个新增病例也会使一切停止运转，意识到失去的都会一去不复返。武汉是第一个到达新冠病毒感染曲线末端的城市，不管之后感染曲线还会不会变，它给活着的我们带来的创伤都是巨大的。</p>
<p>这个城市很多控制疫情的措施都是无法复制的，其他政府即便愿意，也很难推行中国试图实施的无所不包的防疫政策。当然，有一小部分国家的民众可能会支持这种政策，但不管是用什么方式，武汉已经告诉我们防疫需要付出的代价是永远需要保持警惕，以及各项事务的轻重缓急需要重新思考，这样的代价很多人都是难以接受的。</p>
<p>马仁人（音译）是一位 32 岁的企业家，目前掌管着一家营销机构，他在武汉繁华商圈里的一家星巴克告诉了我们他梳理这些问题的方式。星巴克已经开始营业了，但饮料只允许外带，顾客们可以在室外的桌子旁就坐。保安人员在一旁紧紧盯着，他们不时会打断谈话，告诉顾客们在喝完饮料后要戴上口罩，不要坐得太近。马先生戴着时髦的大号墨镜，头上戴着一顶棒球帽，脸上戴着那必不可少的蓝色口罩。他说，为了帮忙照顾父母，1 月 24 日，他就去父母的房子里住下了。但没过多久，他就开始感觉自己的身体不对劲。那段时间，群众们的情绪高涨，因为没有人知道真实的死亡率，武汉人在社交媒体上看到的都是关于医院被挤满的可怕的报道。马先生回忆说：「一天晚上，我写下了我的遗言，打算跟父母告别，然后一个人去医院看病，因为我知道一旦去了，就不知道能不能再回来了。」</p>
<p>他在最后一刻反悔了，身体也开始好转，尽管这还是给他留下了心理阴影。他开始心慌意乱、呼吸急促、心跳加速，他上网查了这些症状，最后得出的结论是：他可能正在经历创伤后压力。马先生认为，这样的经历，会让很多人更加注重内省，更加关注他们最亲近的人。他说：「我们要为我们自己和我们的家人留出更多时间，」还有那些在危机中真正值得坚守的关系，「毕竟患难见真情。」</p>
<p>马先生现在想让自己的公司重新振作起来，最近政府给了他的公司一笔退税款，这是政府刺激经济的措施之一，但这并不能给他带来多少帮助。旅游业面临崩溃，他现在已经没有几个潜在客户有钱做营销了。他说：「我们只能继续前行。」马先生的商业野心已经没有那么强了，就目前而言，他觉得这没问题。他说：「以前我们起早贪黑地工作，努力抓住各种机会，」现在，「我认识的所有人，2020 年的目标都是：活下来。」</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first epicenter is coming back to life, but not as anyone knew it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every workday at Lenovo’s tablet and phone factory on the outskirts of Wuhan, arriving employees report to a supervisor for the first of at least four temperature checks. The results are fed into a data collection system designed by staff. Anyone above 37.3C (99.1F) is automatically flagged, triggering an investigation by an in-house “anti-virus task force.”</p>
<p>Daily routines at the facility, which reopened on March 28 after stopping for over two months because of the coronavirus pandemic that began in this central Chinese city, have been entirely reengineered to minimize the risk of infection. Before returning to the site, staff members had to be tested both for the virus and for antibodies that indicate past illness, and they had to wait for their results in isolation at a dedicated dormitory. Once cleared, they returned to work to find the capacity of meeting rooms built for six reduced to three and the formerly communal cafeteria tables partitioned off by vertical barriers covered in reminders to avoid conversation. Signs everywhere indicate when areas were last disinfected, and robots are deployed wherever possible to transport supplies, so as to reduce the number of people moving from place to place. Elevators, too, are an artifact of the Before Times; everyone now has to take the stairs, keeping their distance from others all the way.</p>
<p>Presiding over all these measures one Sunday in mid-April was Qi Yue, head of Wuhan operations for Beijing-based Lenovo Group Ltd. Qi, who’s 48, with closely cropped hair and a sturdy frame, had been visiting his hometown of Tianjin, in China’s north, when the government sealed off Wuhan from the rest of the country on Jan. 23. It had taken him until Feb. 9 to get home—and he was only able to make it by buying a train ticket to Changsha, farther down the line, and begging the crew to let him get off in Wuhan. His job was now to bring the factory slowly back to life while emphasizing vigilance. Compared with keeping the virus out of the plant, he said, “how much production we can deliver comes second.”</p>
<p>Qi is one of millions of people in Wuhan trying to figure out what economic and social life looks like after the worst pandemic in a century. In some respects they’re in a decent position. The outbreak in Hubei province peaked in mid-February, and according to official statistics there are now almost no new infections occurring (though other governments have cast doubt on China’s figures). But scientists warn that the novel coronavirus is stealthy and robust, and a resurgence is still possible until there’s a reliable vaccine. How to balance that risk against the need to reignite an industrial hub of more than 10 million people is a formidable dilemma—one governments around the world will soon be facing.</p>
<p>So far, Wuhan’s answer has been to create a version of normal that would appear utterly alien to people in London, Milan, or New York—at least for the moment. While daily routines have largely resumed, there remain significant restrictions on a huge range of activities, from funerals to hosting visitors at home. Bolstered by China’s powerful surveillance state, even the simplest interactions are mediated by a vast infrastructure of public and private monitoring intended to ensure that no infection goes undetected for more than a few hours.</p>
<p>But inasmuch as citizens can return to living as they did before January, it’s not clear, after what they’ve endured, that they really want to. Shopping malls and department stores are open again, but largely empty. The same is true of restaurants; people are ordering in instead. The subway is quiet, but autos are selling: If being stuck in traffic is annoying, at least it’s socially distanced.</p>
<p>Qi figures he’s probably on the right side of this economic rebalancing. Tablets are in high demand as schools around the world switch to remote learning, and companies contemplating a work-from-home future aren’t likely to skimp on technology budgets. Since restarting operations, he’s hired more than 1,000 workers, bringing the on-site total above 10,000, and production lines are running at full capacity.</p>
<p>He said he was painfully aware, however, of how quickly work would stop if even one employee contracted the virus. “In my meetings with my staff I always tell them, ‘No loosening up, no loosening up.’ We can’t allow any accidents.”</p>
<p>More than 80% of China’s almost 84,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, and more than 95% of the roughly 4,600 confirmed deaths, have been in Hubei, of which Wuhan is the capital and largest city. Controlling the outbreak there, after a series of mistakes by President Xi Jinping’s government, which initially downplayed the risk of human-to-human transmission and failed to prevent widespread infection of medical personnel, required a herculean effort. More than 40,000 doctors and other medical staff were dispatched from other regions to reinforce existing facilities and operate field hospitals built in the space of 10 days, and car and electronics companies were pressed into making protective gear. People suspected of having the disease were required to move into dormitories and hotels repurposed as isolation facilities, and allowed to go home only after they’d been declared infection-free.</p>
<p>Hubei was the last region of China to resume daily life, with curbs on movement lifted progressively from late March until April 8, more than three months after the epidemic began. The government presented the moment as a decisive victory—part of a comprehensive effort to rewrite the narrative of the virus as a Communist Party triumph, in contrast to its catastrophic spread in Western democracies.</p>
<p>Late on the night of April 7, crowds began arriving at Wuchang station, one of three large railway hubs in Wuhan. The first outbound train in weeks, to Guangzhou, was scheduled to leave at 12:50 a.m., followed by a dense schedule of departures to many of China’s major cities. (Wuhan’s position at the junction of several major rail and road routes, along with its industrial heft, has invited frequent comparisons to Chicago.) Police in black uniforms and medical masks seemed to be everywhere. “Scan your code!” they shouted at travelers approaching the departure gates. The public-private “health code” system that China developed to manage Covid-19, hosted on the Alipay and WeChat apps but deeply linked with the government, assigns one of three viral risk statuses—red, yellow, or green—to every citizen. It’s a powerful tool with clear potential for abuse. A green QR code, which denotes a low risk of having the virus, is the general default, while coming into contact with an infected person can trigger a yellow code and a mandatory quarantine. Red is for a likely or confirmed case.</p>
<p>Travel between cities requires a green code, and while Zeng Xiao, 22, had hers and felt fine, she was nervous about making her train. “There’s still a chance I’ll be stopped if my temperature is too high,” she said as she neared the departure zone. Before going to the station, Zeng had checked repeatedly for a fever, worried that being even a little bit warm would prevent her from getting to Guangzhou, where she works as a teacher. “I haven’t seen my cat in almost three months,” she said. She didn’t have to worry. Her temperature scan was normal, and she was soon able to board her train south.</p>
<p>Another passenger leaving on the first day, Qin Xin’an, 26, had been stranded since the lockdown began. He’d been on vacation in Wuhan when Hubei was cut off, and no amount of pleading with officials could get him on a train out. By mid-February he was living off online loans. “I was eating instant noodles for every meal,” he said. He ended up getting a bed in an austere dormitory constructed by the local government for people who couldn’t leave. He also found work doing odd jobs at Leishenshan Hospital, one of the temporary infirmaries built to handle coronavirus patients. He’d lost his regular job, at a company in Jiangsu province that makes robots, because he couldn’t get back, and was now headed to Guangdong to look for another one and see his family. He hadn’t told his parents where he’d been all this time; as far as they knew, he was away working. “I will not tell them I was in Wuhan,” Qin said.</p>
<p>When dawn broke, Wuhan came cautiously back to life. Hairdressers were some of the first businesses to fill up. The roads were noticeably busier, and workers flowed back into office towers in the city center. But these new freedoms felt distinctly provisional. At the entrance to every mall or public building, guards stood sentry with temperature scanners, ready to turn away anyone whose reading was too high. Green codes, required even to ride the subway, have become the city’s most precious possession, and one that’s easy to lose. Merely visiting a building around the same time as a person later found to be infected can turn them yellow. And apartment compounds still reserve the right to bar residents from leaving if cases are reported there, as they did during the lockdown.</p>
<p>Even in the first city to confront the virus, following a containment effort as intense as any in the history of public health, the danger remains acute. “Asymptomatic cases and imported cases are still risks,” Wang Xinghuan, the president of one of the city’s major hospitals and of the Leishenshan facility, told reporters at a press conference before the latter’s closing. And many residents are still susceptible. Wang’s hospital gave antibody tests to all 3,600 of its staff, and fewer than 3% came back positive—a result that shows “there’s no herd immunity in Wuhan.” There’s only one way to durably protect the population, he said: a vaccine.</p>
<p>Wuhan’s businesses are nevertheless hoping for a safe but speedy return to conspicuous consumption. In the days before the city fully reopened for business, the sales team at a local Audi dealership gathered for their daily meeting. The 20 or so salespeople were all dressed in dark suits and face masks, standing well over a meter apart in neat columns. As a manager briefed them on the day’s plans, a colleague made his way through the group, spraying everyone with disinfectant as they spun around to ensure full coverage. “Customers may not be kind enough to tell you if they don’t feel well, so try not to bring them into the store,” the manager said. “Just talk to them at the entrance if possible.”</p>
<p>After reopening on March 23, the dealership had been selling about seven cars per day, on pace with last year despite all the restrictions. Most were relatively low-end vehicles, such as the A3, which retails for about 200,000 yuan ($28,000)—the kind of car often bought by families to complement a bigger, fancier model. “People are not willing to take public transport in Wuhan,” said the marketing director, who asked to be identified by only his surname, Pan. “And they don’t dare commute by Didi”—the ubiquitous ride-hailing app. The focus now, Pan said, was on following up with people who’d expressed interest in an Audi in the past but hadn’t bought one. They might be ready to bite. The dealership was looking to expand its current staff of about 150, and employees would soon receive the pay they’d missed during the lockdown. Another salesperson added, “It’s like a boom.”</p>
<p>For many other businesses in Wuhan, though, it’s anything but. Benny Xiao is director of international operations at Wuhan Boyuan Paper &amp; Plastic Co., which produces the kinds of unremarkable but essential goods that still form the backbone of Chinese industry. In his case, they’re disposable cups, which Boyuan sells to U.S. airlines and Japanese retailers, among other clients. Xiao works from an office inside a dilapidated residential compound, and, wearing a battered gray blazer over a green button-down, he didn’t quite look the part of an international dealmaker. But he beamed with pride as he showed off a glass cabinet in his office stuffed with examples of his craft, from thin plastic vessels for economy-class soda to a sturdy tumbler he’d tried, unsuccessfully, to sell to Starbucks Corp.</p>
<p>The first months of the pandemic were challenging for Xiao, as they were for everyone in Wuhan. His wife, now retired, spent her career as a doctor at Xiehe Hospital, one of the first to report cases of what was later identified as the coronavirus, and she’d begun hearing from colleagues in mid-January about the impending crisis. Sick residents “were lining up outside Xiehe at 10 p.m. in the freezing cold,” many of them “older people who could barely make it,” Xiao recalled. “Patients were really desperately looking for help.” He and his wife had stocked up on food before the lockdown began, but three weeks in they started to run out. Unlike in Europe and the U.S., Wuhan’s containment measures made it difficult for people to leave their buildings, even to buy groceries, forcing them to rely on delivery apps, government drop-offs, and neighbors who wrangled permission to go out. At one point, Xiao had to spend 26 yuan (almost $4) for a single cabbage, more than triple the usual price. Some of the vegetables provided by local officials were barely edible.</p>
<p>He returned in late March to a company in severe trouble. Orders in the first half of the year were headed for a 50% drop, with demand from food deliveries failing to offset the calamitous decline in air travel. The government had made some financial help available, but Xiao wasn’t sure he’d be able to avoid layoffs. “Back in January and February, I was expecting things to come back to normal in April,” he said. Instead, “I was just calling the bank this morning to tell them that I can’t repay the interest on our loan.”</p>
<p>For a country that’s experienced an essentially uninterrupted boom throughout the living memory of anyone younger than 50, broad-based economic pain is deeply unfamiliar. The Chinese economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter of the year, and the International Monetary Fund estimates it will grow just 1.2% in 2020, the worst performance since 1976. Urban unemployment, a widely scrutinized indicator of overall joblessness, rose to a record 6.2% in February before pulling back slightly in March. And it’s not clear what China’s business model will look like in a world where Europe, the U.S., and other key markets for its goods are flirting with a depression.</p>
<p>Xiao is 64, part of a Chinese generation that had seen more than its share of history even before the coronavirus emerged. But he struggled to recall anything in his experience that was more dramatic, save perhaps the famine of the Great Leap Forward, when he was a young child. “This is the biggest crisis of my lifetime,” he said.</p>
<p>The entrance to Wuhan’s Biandanshan Cemetery is marked by an impressive stone gate with a pagoda-style roof and a frieze of a ferocious-looking dragon. But in recent weeks, it’s been partly hidden behind a series of bright yellow crowd control barriers surrounded by temporary metal fencing and watched carefully by police. Almost no one is permitted to enter until April 30, and even then access is likely to be strictly controlled.</p>
<p>Officially, no patients in Wuhan are still dying from Covid-19, but the treatment of those who did pass away remains an extremely sensitive subject. On Tomb-Sweeping Day in early April, when Chinese families traditionally gather to pay respects to their ancestors, Wuhan’s cemeteries were kept closed. Funerals have been banned until at least the end of the month, and family members of the dead have reported pressure from government officials to mourn quickly and quietly. According to the government, these measures are purely a matter of public health, because family gatherings are a potential vector for infection. But the restrictions also help Beijing avoid having funerals become a venue for people to vent anger about how the epidemic was handled, or to ask uncomfortable questions about subjects such as China’s true death toll.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons for maintaining the ban, some mental health providers in Wuhan have expressed fears that the inability to properly mourn loved ones will have deep and enduring psychological consequences. The city’s residents were the first to undergo the unprecedented social shutdown that’s been repeated around the world, and it seems certain to mark many of them for a long time, especially if it’s compounded by a prolonged economic slump.</p>
<p>Yao Jun is among those struggling to move on. The petite 50-year-old is the founder and general manager of Wuhan Welhel Photoelectric Co., a manufacturer of welding helmets and protective masks that exports to France, Germany, and the U.S. She came back to work on March 13 after wading through approvals from four layers of government, including her local neighborhood committee, which took 15 days to assess Welhel’s ability to prevent infections. “We can’t afford to have a single one,” Yao said in an interview at her factory. Every day the production line can run is crucial: Welhel was trying to catch up on orders it hadn’t been able to complete in the first few months of the year, even as Yao wasn’t sure her customers in locked-down overseas markets would be able to take the deliveries. She had no idea when more business would come in, given what’s happening to the global economy.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainties, she was trying to focus on work rather than what the city had just gone through. “I can’t see news about medical workers without crying,” Yao said, choking back tears and rubbing a jade keychain attached to her phone. She was having trouble sleeping, as she turned over the stories of doctors and nurses who’d succumbed to Covid-19 again and again in her head: “I don’t know these people, but if someone tells me what happened to them, it’s devastating. These deaths aren’t just numbers or strange names to me. They’re vivid lives.” She believed that many of her neighbors and colleagues were experiencing similar emotions but might not be willing or able to talk about them. “Many other people are traumatized but can’t recognize the problem or express their feelings,” she said.</p>
<p>The pandemic was causing Yao to rethink her life. She spent almost half of last year on the road, often visiting clients overseas. Now, she said, she wanted to spend much more time at home, keeping her family close. Her son was supposed to return to Australia for university in February, but he was unable to get there, for obvious reasons. Yao didn’t want him to go back.</p>
<p>Even after seemingly world-shattering events, human behavior has a way of reverting to the mean. In the weeks after Sept. 11, commentators predicted the end of globalization, of the skyscraper, of irony—which all, needless to say, persisted. Within a couple of years of the global financial crisis, banks and homebuyers were back to arranging risky mortgages, and the very wealthy were back to, and then well beyond, pre-2008 levels of excess.</p>
<p>It’s reasonable to think this time will be different. Hardly anyone alive today has endured a pandemic this severe, and the basic problem it’s created—that anyone, whether friend, family, or stranger, might be a vector for lethal infection—is uniquely corrosive to the daily interactions that keep countries and economies going. An effective vaccine could be at least a year off, and given what the world has learned about how quickly a novel pathogen can shut everything down, even that might not return things to the way they were. Wuhan was the first place to traverse both sides of the Covid-19 curve, and how it changes, or doesn’t, in the disease’s aftermath will say a lot to the rest of us.</p>
<p>Many of the city’s methods won’t be universally applicable. Few other governments could assemble the all-seeing anti-viral surveillance China is trying to put in place, even if they wanted to. Fewer still, probably, have populations that would tolerate it. But whatever the tactics, the key lesson of Wuhan could be that the price of beating the virus is never-ending vigilance and a reordering of priorities that will be hard for many to accept.</p>
<p>At a Starbucks in one of Wuhan’s fancier shopping districts, Ma Renren, a 32-year-old entrepreneur who runs a small marketing agency, talked about how he was sorting out these questions for himself. The store was open but only serving drinks to go, with customers permitted to sit at outdoor tables. Security guards were keeping a close eye on things, interrupting conversations to tell patrons to keep their masks on between sips and not sit too close together. Ma, who was wearing fashionably oversize glasses, a black baseball cap, and—of course—a light blue medical mask, had gone to stay at his parents’ apartment on Jan. 24, intending to help take care of them. But soon he began to suspect that he might be sick. It was a time of greatly heightened emotion: No one knew the true fatality rate, and people in Wuhan were seeing reports on social media of appalling conditions in overwhelmed hospitals. “I wrote my last words one night and decided to say farewell to my parents and go to the hospital alone the next morning,” Ma recalled. “I knew that if I went, I couldn’t necessarily expect to come back.”</p>
<p>He changed his mind at the last minute and eventually felt better, though the psychological effects lingered. He began having panic attacks, his breath short and his heart pounding. After looking up the symptoms online, he concluded that he was experiencing post-traumatic stress. Experiences like his, Ma thought, would make many people more introspective and more focused on those closest to them. “We will put aside more time for ourselves and our families” and for the other relationships that seemed truly worth holding on to during the crisis, he said. “Misfortune tests the sincerity of friendship.”</p>
<p>Ma was now trying to get his company back on its feet. The government had recently sent him a tax rebate as part of its stimulus measures, but this would help only so much. Tourism has collapsed, and few potential clients have much money for promotion. “There’s nothing to do but move on,” he said. Ma had, inevitably, lowered his ambitions, and for the time being he was all right with that. “We worked nonstop for years, chasing every opportunity,” he said. Now, “everyone I know has one goal for 2020. It’s to survive.”</p>
